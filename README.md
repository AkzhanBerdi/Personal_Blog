### Setting Up and Running Your Friend's Django Project

Follow these steps to clone and launch your friend's Python Django project:

1. Install Django and Pillow:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install django
   python -m pip install Pillow

   ```

2. Clone the Project:
   git clone [link of project]

3. Create a Virtual Environment:
   python3 -m venv .venv

4. Activate the Virtual Environment:
   source .venv/bin/activate

5. Run the Django Development Server:

Now, you can access the project locally in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Make sure to replace [link of project] with the actual Git repository URL of your friend's Django project. These instructions will help you set up and run the project successfully.
